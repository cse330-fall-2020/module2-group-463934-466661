login usernames: nadia, sdweh, new3, user3, testUser, abc, demo
Creative Portion:
// For our creative portion we gave our site the ability to generate new users. This is done by typing the desired new username in the login and submitting. Because the new user does not exist on users.txt, the site will give you the option to go back and retry a valid login, or use the entered login to create a new user file (button-->"create new username"). This creates a new user file in the Mod2Secure directory which has the ability to upload files, remove files, view files, and share files. Once the "create new username" button is pressed, you're redirected to the user's new file list, so the new user can now upload, remove, and view, and share.
//We also gave users the ability to share their uploaded files to other users. All that user would need to know other users' name.The user would type in the username they would like to share to and after clicking share, the file would show up in the recipient's directory of files.
